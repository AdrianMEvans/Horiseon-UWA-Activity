  ## Objectives
  **Horiseon** ("_Customer_") has identified a need to improve their current site. They feel that they are potentially losing out on many sales opportunities because their website does not comply with the latest accessibility standards to aid users with visual, audio or other disabilities to obtain easy access to their site.

  The customer has requested that the site meet the following minimum criteria for accessibility standards:
  1. Latest HTML Semantics to aid in identifying sections. 
  2. HTML elements must be placed in a logical order.
  3. Image elements must all have alt attributes to aid in identifying what is displayed.
  4. Headings should be in sequential order.
  5. Add a Concise and Descriptive title to the page.

  In addition it was also decided to investigate additional tools to test accesibility criteria and see what additional improvements could be put forward. Also to improve accesibility and page loading the HTML code will be inspected for any missing or broken links and the CSS for any potential improvements or consolidation.

  ## Execution

  ### _Customer Requirements_
  A new repository was created in Git Hub - [Horiseon Repository](https://github.com/AdrianMEvans/Horiseon-UWA-Activity.git). The Repository was then cloned to a folder on my harddrive. I added the customer's existing files and started with my initial commit. from there i subsequently made several changes to meet the 5 criteria set by the customer.
  - [x] Semantics were updated to latest HTML 5 naming conventions.
  - [x] Checked that HTML elements were in a logical order for accessibility.
  - [x] Added Alt Attributes to all images.
  - [x] Headings were already placed in Sequential order
  - [x] The title of the page was changed to consicely describe what the customer does.
