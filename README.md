  * Link to _Online Reputation Management_ Section
  * Link to _Social Media Marketing_ Section
2. Hero Section
  * This area contains a large image.
3. Main Element consisting of 3 Sections:

  * _Online Reputation Management_ Section
  * _Social Media Marketing_ Section
4. Aside Section
  * This lists 3 benefits of Digital Marketing in general.
5. Footer Section
  * This section contains some general footer and copyright information.

  ## Objectives
  **Horiseon** ("_Customer_") has identified a need to improve their current site. They feel that they are potentially losing out on many sales opportunities because their website does not comply with the latest accessibility standards to aid users with visual, audio or other disabilities to obtain easy access to their site.

  The customer has requested that the site meet the following minimum criteria for accessibility standards:
  1. Latest HTML Semantics to aid in identifying sections. 
  2. HTML elements must be placed in a logical order.
  3. Image elements must all have alt attributes to aid in identifying what is displayed.
  4. Headings should be in sequential order.
  5. Add a Concise and Descriptive title to the page.

  In addition it was also decided to investigate additional tools to test accesibility criteria and see what additional improvements could be put forward. Also to improve accesibility and page loading the HTML code will be inspected for any missing or broken links and the CSS for any potential improvements or consolidation.

  ## Execution

  ### _Customer Requirements_
  A new repository was created in Git Hub - [Horiseon Repository](https://github.com/AdrianMEvans/Horiseon-UWA-Activity.git). The Repository was then cloned to a folder on my harddrive. I added the customer's existing files and started with my initial commit. I subsequently made several changes to meet the 5 criteria set by the customer.
  - [x] Semantics were updated to latest HTML 5 naming conventions.
  - [x] HTML elements were placed in a logical order for accessibility.
  - [x] Alt Attributes were added to all images.
  - [x] Headings were placed in Sequential order
  - [x] Title of the page changed to consicely describe the customer business.

 ### _Additional implementations_ :punch::punch::punch:
 On inspection it was noted that the Navigation link to _Search Engine Optimisation_ Section were not functioning. It was found that the ID for that section was not inserted so it had no point for the reference. This was corrected.

 We also made use of an online evaluation tool to test our accesibility. [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content.
