  ## Objectives
  **Horiseon** ("_Customer_") has identified a need to improve their current site. They feel that they are potentially losing out on many sales opportunities because their website does not comply with the latest accessibility standards to aid users with visual, audio or other disabilities to obtain easy access to their site.

  The customer has requested that the site meet the following minimum criteria for accessibility standards:
  1. Latest HTML Semantics to aid in identifying sections. 
  2. HTML elements must be placed in a logical order.
  3. Image elements must all have alt attributes to aid in identifying what is displayed.
  4. Headings should be in sequential order.
  5. Add a Concise and Descriptive title to the page.

  In addition it was also decided to investigate additional tools to test accesibility criteria and see what additional improvements could be put forward. Also to improve accesibility and page loading the HTML code will be inspected for any missing or broken links and the CSS for any potential improvements or consolidation.

  ## Execution
